# Baseball Century Assistant (WIP)
[Baseball Century](https://www.baseballcentury.com/) is a game that I have loved playing for many...many hours. It's very simple, make the best 9 player baseball roster with 5 hitters and 4 pitchers.

## Description
The issue with this very simple games comes in when you have to make that 9 player baseball roster. Every Spring Training it is time to select your 5 batters and 4 pitchers, but you are offered 3 up and coming youngsters (2 batters and 1 pitcher) to make the opening day roster and take over for a player currently in your roster.

Although this may seem like a very easy decision. "Just take the highest overalls" right? Well mostly yes, but what if I have a 23 year old up and comer that has a 112 overall, but currently in my roster there is a 20 year old that is 100 overall, who do I take there?

This a question, as well as many others, I hope to answer through this project. It's very easy to be good at Baseball Century and in my experience you can't go wrong choosing either player, but I don't just want to be good...I want to be the **BEST**
